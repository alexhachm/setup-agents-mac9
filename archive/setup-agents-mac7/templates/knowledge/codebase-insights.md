# Codebase Insights

<!-- Master-2 owns this file. Updated during curation cycles and pre-reset distillation. -->
<!-- Max ~2000 tokens. Master-2 enforces this budget during curation. -->
<!-- All masters read this on startup/reset. -->

## Architecture Overview
<!-- Populated after first codebase scan -->

## Coupling Hotspots
<!-- Files that are tightly coupled and must be changed together -->

## Complexity Notes
<!-- Areas that are more complex than they appear -->

## Patterns & Conventions
<!-- Codebase-specific patterns that all agents should follow -->
